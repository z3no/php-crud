# PHP CRUD

***

- **Team challenge:** `Michael` `Pablo` `Alex` `Zeno`
- **CRUD:** `Create Read Update Delete`

***

A new day, a new challenge, a team challenge. The group had to choose if this challenge would be a team challenge or a solo one.
It was a tie, but in the end we **flipped a coin** and the team won.
Our group is glad about it, because in the end this will prepare us better for the future when we start our development career.
Let's get started!

## The Mission
The mission is to create a CRUD system to store student, teacher, group and campus information in the database.
We will use the MVC structure that is provided. We will end up with at least 4 models and 4 controllers, but this could be more.
